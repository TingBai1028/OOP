=== Question 12 ===

It will print "Woof Woof"


????? HOW TO EXPLAIN


In main we create a new instance dog, then we ceate a animal object, 
we let anmal object = dog, which sent animal point to teh address of dog.
Finally we call animal.noise, by reference we called dog.noise, which is a override method to animal. hence it sould print woof woof.


Sample anser: 
- Dynamic polymorphism ( runtime polymorphism )
    - Compile-time type vs runtime type:
        - compile-time type: what compiler thinks the variable is, based on its declaration.
        - runtime type: the actual object thaat the variable points to when the program is running.

    In this question:
        Animal animal = new dog();

        compile time type of animal is Animal, based on its declaration.
        runtime type of animal is dog, which is the actual object that the variable points to when the program is running.

    - Method dispatch:
        - at runtime, looks at the actual object type and runs the overriden version of noise() inside dog.
